# Hi, I'm @MeisQuietude. Nice to meet you üëã

## Briefly, I...

- 'm Stepan, the world saw me on December 15, 2000. About a decade and a half later, I answered it for the first time: `Hello World!`
- live in Yekaterinburg, Russia
- specialize in coding server business logic (backend)
- enjoy programming and learning new technologies
- agree that modern problems require modern solutions.

## Detailed

My primary programming language is a [Python](https://www.python.org/), secondary is a [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/).

I can work as a full-stack developer, but my preference is to remain backend. I am engaged in the development of different complexity levels web-sevices: both simple and complicated.

My goal is to become a strong developer. He knows how to write code and solve trivial problems, but also has extensive knowledge in the entire IT-sphere. At the same time, it is enough to be a professional only in his field. He's not a nerd, he breaks the unfairly formed stereotype of closed-minded people forever sitting at the computer.

I'm sure the code should be clean, accurate and self-documenting. I understand SOLID and use it in my solutions if the project has a future. I've read: R. Martin "Clean Code", R. Martin "Clean architecture" (partly), –ú. –ò–ª—å—è—Ö–æ–≤ "–ü–∏—à–∏, —Å–æ–∫—Ä–∞—â–∞–π" (M. Ilyakhov ~"Write, shorten"), –ê. –ë—Ö–∞—Ä–≥–∞–≤–∞ "–ì—Ä–æ–∫–∞–µ–º –∞–ª–≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–º—ã" ~"Learn algorithms".

I understand the O-notation of the algorithms and can apply them.

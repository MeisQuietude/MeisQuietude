# Hi, I'm @MeisQuietude. Nice to meet you üëã

## Briefly, I...

- 'm Stepan, the world saw me on December 15, 2000. About a decade and a half later, I answered him for the first time: `Hello World!`
- live in Yekaterinburg, Russia
- specialize in writing server business logic (backend)
- enjoy programming and learning new technologies
- agree that modern problems require modern solutions.

### Detailed

My primary programming language is a [Python](https://www.python.org/), secondary is a [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/).

I can work as a frontend or full-stack developer, but my preference is to remain backend. I am engaged in the development of different complexity levels web-sevices: both simple and complicated.

My goal is to become a strong developer. He not only knows how to write code and solve trivial problems, but also has extensive knowledge in the entire IT-sphere. At the same time, it is enough to be a professional only in his field. He's not a nerd, he breaks the unfairly formed stereotype of closed-minded people forever sitting at the computer.

I'm sure the code should be clean, accurate and self-documenting. I understand and use SOLID in my solutions if the project has a future. I've read: R. Martin "Clean Code", R. Martin "Clean architecture" (partly), –ú. –ò–ª—å—è—Ö–æ–≤ "–ü–∏—à–∏, —Å–æ–∫—Ä–∞—â–∞–π" (M. Ilyakhov ~"Write, shorten"), –ê. –ë—Ö–∞—Ä–≥–∞–≤–∞ "–ì—Ä–æ–∫–∞–µ–º –∞–ª–≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–º—ã" ~"Learn algorithms".

I understand the O-notation of the algorithms and can apply them.

### Experience

I started my career as a Python-developer in the [Rydlab](https://www.rydlab.ru/) and work there since August 8, 2019 to January 18, 2021.
Since January 19, 2021, I've been working as a Python-developer in the data engineering department for the [SpectrumData (Avtocod)](https://avtocod.ru/).

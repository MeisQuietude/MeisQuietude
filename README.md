# Hi, I'm @MeisQuietude. Nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

## Briefly

My name is Stepan, and I was born on December 15, 2000. About a decade and a half later, I wrote my first program: `Hello World!`.

I currently reside in Yekaterinburg, Russia, and specialize in coding server business logic (backend).

I have a passion for programming and enjoy learning about new technologies.

I strongly believe that modern problems require modern solutions.

## Detailed

My primary programming language is [Python (3.4 -> latest)](https://www.python.org/), and my secondary language is [JavaScript]((https://www.javascript.com/)) (TypeScript).

I can work as a full-stack developer, but my preference is to focus on backend development. I have experience in developing web services of varying levels of complexity, from simple to advanced.

My goal is to become a strong developer who not only knows how to write code and solve complex problems but also has extensive knowledge of the entire IT sphere. However, I understand that it is sufficient to be a professional in my field. I am not a nerd and do not fit the stereotype of a closed-minded person who spends all their time in front of a computer.

I believe that code should be clean, accurate, and self-documenting. I understand the SOLID principles and apply them to my solutions if the project has a future. I have read several books on the topic, including "Clean Code" and "Clean Architecture" by R. Martin, "Write, Shorten" by M. Ilyakhov, and "Groking Algorithms" by A. Bhargava.

I also have a strong understanding of algorithmic complexity (O-notation) and can apply it effectively.

### Experience

1. August 8, 2019 - January 18, 2021. Python-developer in the [Rydlab](https://www.rydlab.ru/)

I have developed various modules for open-source ERP systems individually tailored to each client's needs, primarily using Python. In addition, I have created multiple scripts and modules for internal systems using bash and Python.

Furthermore, I have successfully maintained and fine-tuned features of a web portal that was developed in pure JavaScript.
